The system give user a simple interface to Read, Insert, Update, Delete data, while the database is initialed by two csv file of filter orders.

# How to run application:
1.Backend:
You need to download a mySqlworkbench for databse connecting. I attached the SQL scripts in the backend folder;
After setting up the mySql databse, you should run "npm install" to install node_modules;
Lastly you can use node to host the server,I recommend use command "nodemon index" to start the server on port 3001.

2.Front end:
You need to firstly run "npm install" if you have node installed. This is used to install all of dependancies for front-end.
After installing all of dependancies, you can run "npm start" the and the application will be host on port 3000.
The system will automatically pop out after this command.
